# Conses in Ruby: So Much More Than Lists

This was a talk I gave at
[STL Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/stlruby/)
on Monday, September 12, AD 2016.

In this talk I discuss the differences between Lisp-style lists built out of conses, and Ruby's native arrays, and why you might want the lispy thing.

And I've made a [Cons Ruby Gem](https://github.com/cgore/ruby-cons).
